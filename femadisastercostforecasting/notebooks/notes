Import Libraries
Import Data
Review model types
Choose 2-3 models
Feature engineering
Additional EDA
Hyperparameter tuning
Fit models to training data set
Transform Train and Test sets (but don't fit to Test or else data leakage)
Evaluate models...
	Classification - accuracy, recall, precision, and F1
	Regression - MSE, MAE, R^2

EDA steps
df.corr() - textual correlation
sns.pairplot(df)
sns.heatmap(df.corr())
sns.scatter(data=df, x='independent', y='dependent variable')
sns.regplot(data=df, x='independent', y='dependent variable')


Feature Selection: Use techniques like stepwise regression, LASSO/Ridge, or feature importance scores to identify the most impactful features.   
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA can reduce the number of features while preserving important information.
