Modeling Notes


Review model types
choose 2-3 models
Feature engineering
Hyperparameter tuning
Fit models to training data set
Transform Train and Test sets (but don't fit to Test or else data leakage)
Evaluate models...
	Classification - accuracy, recall, precision, and F1
	Regression - MSE, MAE, R^2
