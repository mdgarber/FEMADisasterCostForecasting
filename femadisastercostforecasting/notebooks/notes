Modeling Notes

Goal: predict totaldisastercost of FEMA for their fiscal year 2025
Import Libraries
Import Data
Review model types
Choose 2-3 models
Feature engineering
Additional EDA
Hyperparameter tuning
Fit models to training data set
Transform Train and Test sets (but don't fit to Test or else data leakage)
Evaluate models...
	Classification - accuracy, recall, precision, and F1
	Regression - MSE, MAE, R^2
